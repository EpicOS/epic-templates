# EpicTemplates
An open source project to build starer templates for various types of projects.

This project is not as much about making templates as it is about learning how to contribute to open source. This project was started by students at [Epicodus](http://epicodus.com), but is open to any interested student or jr. developer who wants to learn how to contribute to open source.

## How to contribute:
* We will have a main index page to indicate what templates are available.
* Each template should have it's own directory.

## Templates Included: (list yours here when contributing!)
* HTML Fragments: contains long form for person-type data entry, intended to include things like forms or page layouts that can be reused.
* Spark-Template: a starter template for projects using Java/Spark/Postgres
